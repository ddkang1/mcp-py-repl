docker run -it ghcr.io/ddkang1/mcp-py-repl
```

The container includes:
- Python 3.12
- UV package manager for fast dependency installation
- Pre-configured environment for MCP

## Features

## Running the Server

This server is intended to be used via Docker.

```
  args:
    [
      "run",
      "-i",
      "--rm",
      "--pull=always",
      "-v",
      "./test_data:/mnt/data/",
      "ghcr.io/ddkang1/mcp-py-repl:latest",
    ]
```

The server provides three tools:

1. `execute_python`: Execute Python code with persistent variables

   - `code`: The Python code to execute
   - `reset`: Optional boolean to reset the session

2. `list_variables`: Show all variables in the current session

3. `install_package`: Install a package from pypi

## Examples

Set a variable:

```python
a = 42
```

Use the variable:

```python
print(f"The value is {a}")
```

List all variables:

```python
# Use the list_variables tool
```

Reset the session:

```python
# Use execute_python with reset=true
```
